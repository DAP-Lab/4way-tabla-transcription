Contents:
1. Audio examples
  * Audio examples to demonstrate each of the augmentation methods applied to a short clip of tabla audio.

2. Code
  * Python scripts with our implementations of different augmentation methods as described in Section 3.2 of the paper.
  * A python script to detect and classify strokes in a given test audio of tabla playing, using the best trained 1-way models described in Section 3.1.2 of the paper.


3. Dataset
  * All audios and annotations newly added for this study will be released for research purposes (not uploaded here due to size constraints)
