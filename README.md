Contents:
1. Code
	* **Stroke classification**: python script to detect and classify strokes in a given audio of tabla playing, using the 1-way models described in Section 3.1.2 of the paper trained on augmented data using the best augmentation method (see Table 7 in paper).
	* **Data augmentation**: python scripts with implementations of different augmentation methods as described in Section 3.2 of the paper.
	* For further details on code usage, see respective folders in [code](code).

2. Audio examples
	* Audio examples to demonstrate each of the augmentation methods applied to a short clip of tabla audio.

3. Dataset
