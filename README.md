Contents:
1. Code
	* A python script to detect and classify strokes in a given audio of tabla playing, using the 1-way models described in Section 3.1.2 of the paper trained on augmented data using the best augmentation method (see Table 7 in paper).
	* Python scripts with implementations of different augmentation methods as described in Section 3.2 of the paper.

2. Audio examples
	* Audio examples to demonstrate each of the augmentation methods applied to a short clip of tabla audio.

3. Dataset
	* Audios and annotations prepared for this study will be released for research purposes (not uploaded here due to size constraints; link coming soon)
	

4. Additional experimental details & results
	* A document with some additional details on the methods described in Section 3 of the paper.
